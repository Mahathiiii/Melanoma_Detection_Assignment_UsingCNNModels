## Problem Statement

### Business Understanding

# Problem Statement:

Develop a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow to accurately detect melanoma, a potentially fatal skin cancer that accounts for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths if not detected early. This model aims to analyze medical images and assist dermatologists by identifying the presence of melanoma, thereby reducing the manual effort required in diagnosis.

The dataset contains 2,357 images of both malignant and benign skin conditions, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The images are categorized by type, with melanomas and moles slightly dominant in number. Each disease category is represented by an equal number of images, except for these two classes.

The dataset includes the following skin conditions:

* Actinic keratosis
* Basal cell carcinoma
* Dermatofibroma
* Melanoma
* Nevus
* Pigmented benign keratosis
* Seborrheic keratosis
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Vascular lesion


### Business Goal


Using this data, the goal is to build a robust multiclass classification model to effectively differentiate between these nine distinct skin conditions.


### Business Risk

- Incorrect classification of skin cancer poses significant health risks.

## Project Pipeline

1. **Data Reading/Data Understanding**: Define the path for train and test images.
2. **Dataset Creation**: Create train & validation datasets with a batch size of 32. Resize images to 180x180.
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Visualize one instance of each of the nine classes present in the dataset.
4. **Model Building & Training**: 
   - Build a CNN model to detect the 9 classes. Normalize pixel values (0,1).
   - Choose an optimizer and loss function.
   - Train for ~20 epochs, checking for overfitting or underfitting.
5. **Data Augmentation**: Apply augmentation to resolve overfitting/underfitting.
6. **Class Distribution**: Examine class distribution, identifying the least and most dominant classes.
7. **Handling Class Imbalances**: Use the Augmentor library to address class imbalances.
8. **Final Model Training**: Train the model for ~30 epochs on the augmented and balanced data.
